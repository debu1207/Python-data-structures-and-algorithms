"""
Bachgold problem is very easy to formulate. Given a positive integer n represent it as a sum of maximum possible number of prime numbers.
One can prove that such representation exists for any integer greater than 1.
Recall that integer k is called prime if it is greater than 1 and has exactly two positive integer divisors â€” 1 and k.
