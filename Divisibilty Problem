"""
DIVISIBLITY PROBLEM
You are given two positive integers a and b. In one move you can increase a by 1 (replace a with a+1). 
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b. 
It is possible, that you have to make 0 moves, as a is already divisible by b.
You have to answer t independent test cases.

T=int(input())
e=[]
for i in range(T):
     l=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
     e.append(l)

def output(a,b):
     if a%b==0:
          return 0
     else:
          return (b-(a%b))

for i in range(T):
     print(output(e[i][0],e[i][1]))
