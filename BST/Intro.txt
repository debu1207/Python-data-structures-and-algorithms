Binary Search Tree:

BST is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the followign properties:
1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with kyes lesser than the node's key.

2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
