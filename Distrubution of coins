"""
Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is ai. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, 
but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a=[1,2,4,3,3,2], 
he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1,2,3],[2,3,4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.
