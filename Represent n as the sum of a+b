"""
There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have n candies. You want to distribute these n candies between two sisters in such a way that:

Alice will get a (a>0) candies;
Betty will get b (b>0) candies;
each sister will get some integer number of candies;
Alice will get a greater amount of candies than Betty (i.e. a>b);
all the candies will be given to one of two sisters (i.e. a+b=n).
Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly n candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.

Formally, find the number of ways to represent n as the sum of n=a+b, where a and b are positive integers and a>b.
