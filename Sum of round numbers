"""
A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called round if it is of the form d00...0.
In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. 
In particular, all numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive) are round.

For example, the following numbers are round: 4000, 1, 9, 800, 90. The following numbers are not round: 110, 707, 222, 1001.

You are given a positive integer n (1≤n≤104). 
Represent the number n as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). 
In other words, you need to represent the given number n as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.
