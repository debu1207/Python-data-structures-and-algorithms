# Deletion in a Binary Tree

"""
Given a binary tree, delete a node from it by making sure that 
tree shrinks from the bottom (i.e. the deleted node is replaced
 by bottom most and rightmost node). This is different from BST
 deletion. Here we do not have any order among elements, so we replace with last element
