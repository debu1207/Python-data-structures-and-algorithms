CircularLL_Intro

It is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be singly circular linked list or doubly cirular linked list.

ADVANTAGES:
1. Any node can be a starting node. We can traverse the whole list by starting from any point.

2. It is useful for implementation of queue. We can maintain a pointer to the lat inserted node and front can always be obtained as next of last.

3. Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list. Used in operating system.

4. Circular doubly linked lists are used for implementaiton of advanced data structures like fibonacci Heap.
